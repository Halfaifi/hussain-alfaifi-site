                    Before my time in the defense industry, I gained invaluable sales experience as a Sales Engineer at Arabian Air Conditioning Co. (Carrier). In this role, I was in charge of the Residential and Light Commercial (RLC) sales division. This position was unique because it required me to combine my technical knowledge of mechanical systems with strong communication and sales skills. I was not just selling a product; I was assisting customers, contractors, and consultants in making informed decisions by helping them select the proper RLC equipment for their needs.

                    My engineering background was a significant asset in this role. I could accurately assess a client's requirements and recommend the most efficient and suitable Carrier products. This technical insight built trust and confidence with customers, as they knew they were receiving expert advice. I also provided support for customers who used Carrier's Hourly Analysis Program (HAP), a sophisticated software for designing HVAC systems. My ability to assist with this technical tool further solidified my position as a reliable and knowledgeable resource, moving beyond a simple sales transaction to a true partnership.

                    The experience at Carrier taught me that sales is about more than just persuasion; it's about providing value and building relationships. My role demonstrated that an engineerâ€™s analytical skills can be a powerful tool in a commercial setting. It allowed me to solve customer problems, offer tailored solutions, and contribute directly to the company's growth by being a trusted technical advisor. This experience laid the groundwork for my future career, proving that my engineering skills were highly transferable and valuable in various professional contexts.
