                    As a Manufacturing Manager, my focus was on overseeing the entire production cycle, from raw materials to finished goods. This included key operations like laser cutting, bending, welding, machining, and painting. My responsibilities went beyond just managing people and machines; I was constantly looking for ways to improve our processes and increase efficiency. My experience at the Military Industries Corporation in this role taught me that a deep understanding of each step is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and implementing effective solutions. One of my key initiatives was to improve the storage and flow of manufactured materials, which directly reduced waste and improved our production timelines.

                    This role was a balancing act between technical expertise and strategic management. I had to ensure that all our fabrication operations followed the correct Welding Procedure Specifications (WPS)  and that every part met our rigorous quality standards. Simultaneously, I was responsible for managing the engineering change procedure for our fabrication operations, which meant adapting our production lines to new designs or material specifications. It required close collaboration with the engineering and R&D teams to ensure that new designs were not only feasible but also efficient to manufacture.

                    The experience as a Manufacturing Manager was a masterclass in leadership. I learned how to motivate teams, resolve conflicts, and drive a culture of continuous improvement. The ability to see the bigger picture while also understanding the fine details of each process was essential. From implementing new storage strategies to participating in ISO 9001 Quality Management System audits, every task was aimed at creating a more streamlined, efficient, and high-quality production environment. This role solidified my belief that true manufacturing leadership is about empowering your team and optimizing every part of the production system.
