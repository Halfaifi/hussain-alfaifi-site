                    After more than a decade in the professional world, I've had the privilege of working in a diverse range of roles, from a Production Engineer to a Supply Chain Manager and a Sales Engineer. This 13-year journey, primarily within multinational environments, has been a masterclass in professional growth and adaptability. My career has shown me that while technical expertise is crucial, the ability to lead, work in a team, and communicate effectively are what truly drive long-term success. I’ve seen firsthand how a comprehensive understanding of a business, from production to sales, allows you to contribute more meaningfully to an organization's goals.

                    One of the most important lessons I've learned is the value of continuous improvement and the power of knowledge transfer. I’ve had the opportunity to develop and optimize procurement operations, enhance safety awareness, and even conduct short training programs for welders and new engineers. This is not just about sharing what you know but about empowering others and elevating the entire team. Similarly, my experience with implementing large-scale software like SAP S4/Hana taught me to embrace new challenges and leverage technology as a tool for efficiency and growth, no matter your initial background.

                    Ultimately, my career has been a testament to the power of a well-rounded skill set. My formal education in Mechanical Engineering  provided a strong foundation, but my practical experience in leadership, project management, and cross-functional roles has built a career defined by versatility and a commitment to excellence. I have had the opportunity to apply skills like 2D/3D design, internal auditing, and basic programming in various contexts, proving that professional success is a journey of continuous learning and leveraging a diverse range of abilities to solve problems and create value.
