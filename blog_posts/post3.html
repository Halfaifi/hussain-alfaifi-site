                    My role as Supply Chain Manager at Military Industries Corporation was centered on one of the most transformative projects of my career: the implementation of SAP S4/Hana. This was a comprehensive undertaking, requiring a deep understanding of our existing processes and a vision for how they could be improved with technology. My main responsibility was to spearhead the implementation of the Material Management (MM) and Warehouse Management (WM) modules. This involved everything from mapping out current workflows to developing and optimizing new procurement and warehouse operations to fit the new system. It was a complex puzzle where every piece, from raw material procurement to final product delivery, had to be carefully considered.

                    A critical phase of this project was the preparation and verification of master data. This was a tedious but essential task, as accurate data is the foundation of any successful ERP system. I had to ensure that all the information required for the new system was clean, consistent, and ready to be imported. This process highlighted the importance of data integrity and the significant impact it has on an entire organization's efficiency and decision-making. Working closely with various teams, I developed KPIs for both the Military Transportation Vehicle Factory (MTVF) and the Supply Chain Department, ensuring that our progress and success were measurable and aligned with business goals.

                    Ultimately, my role extended to overseeing the SAP Start-up and Go-Live process. This was the culmination of months of hard work, planning, and training. The transition was a testament to the meticulous preparation and collaborative spirit of the team. We successfully navigated the challenges of a major system overhaul, demonstrating that with careful planning, strong leadership, and a focus on data accuracy, a large-scale technological transformation is not only possible but can lead to significant operational improvements.
