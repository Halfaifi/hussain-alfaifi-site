                    As a Welding Engineer at Military Industries Corporation, my days were a mix of technical oversight, team management, and strategic planning. My primary responsibilities involved supervising welding operations, ensuring every weld adhered to the strict Welding Procedure Specifications (WPS). This role wasn't just about inspecting welds; it was about ensuring the safety, integrity, and quality of our products, which included military trucks. I was also heavily involved in training programs for our welders, working to enhance their skills and competency. This hands-on training was critical, as it directly impacted our production efficiency and the overall quality of our output.

                    One of the most defining moments of my time as a Welding Engineer was our initiative to achieve American Welding Society (AWS) certification for our factory welders. This was a challenging but rewarding process that required meticulous preparation, from reviewing and revising welding procedures to conducting rigorous practice sessions. Guiding a team through this process not only elevated our factoryâ€™s standards but also provided our welders with a globally recognized credential, boosting their morale and professional standing. It was a clear demonstration of how investing in people and processes leads to tangible, high-value outcomes for a company.

                    The experience taught me that technical expertise is just one part of the equation; true success lies in leadership and a commitment to excellence. By optimizing process time and enhancing the competency of our team, we not only improved our factory's output but also established a culture of quality and continuous improvement. The journey from initial technology transfer to securing a prestigious certification for our team was a powerful lesson in project management, technical leadership, and the immense satisfaction of seeing a team achieve its full potential.
