                    My career took a fascinating turn when I transitioned from manufacturing and production to a Sales and Marketing Engineer role at the Military Industries Corporation. This shift provided a completely new perspective on the business, moving me from the creation of products to their distribution and customer relationship management. My primary responsibility was managing the sales orders and deliveries of military trucks and spare parts, a task that required not just organizational skills but also a deep understanding of our products and customers' needs. It was a role that bridged the technical and commercial sides of the business, requiring me to effectively communicate the value of our products.

                    I also provided essential support to potential customers, assisting them with technical inquiries and helping to facilitate new sales orders. This required me to be a problem-solver and a trusted advisor, using my engineering background to answer detailed questions about product specifications, capabilities, and applications. Furthermore, I managed projects using MS Projects, ensuring that every stage of a sales order, from initial inquiry to final delivery, was tracked and managed efficiently. I also handled all sales and marketing operations within our new SAP system, which further connected my technical knowledge with my customer-facing role.

                    This role was instrumental in broadening my professional horizons. It taught me the importance of customer engagement and the critical role that sales and marketing play in a company's success. My ability to speak both the language of engineering and the language of business allowed me to serve as a vital link between our factory and our clients. This experience proved that a strong technical foundation can be a powerful asset in a commercial role, enabling you to build trust and credibility by offering informed, expert advice.
